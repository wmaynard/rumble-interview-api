# Interview Service
A very quick and dirty API for conducting web engineer interviews.

## Acknowledgment

Interview Service was originally created for Rumble Entertainment (which later became R Studios), a mobile gaming company.  The service was not used for our game, Towers & Titans, but was rather a very quick and dirty tool I wrote to give web engineer candidates a practical, live test with a real API to play with.  As such it was never deployed beyond our dev cluster and has very little value / documentation / planning - it also doesn't reflect a finished product nor evolve alongside other platform projects.

R Studios unfortunately closed its doors in July 2024.  This project has been released as open source with permission.

As of this writing, there may still be existing references to Rumble's resources, such as Confluence links, but their absence doesn't have any significant impact.  Some documentation will also be missing until it can be recreated here, since with the company closure any feature specs and explainer articles originally written for Confluence / Slack channels were lost.

While Rumble is shutting down, I'm grateful for the opportunities and human connections I had working there.
